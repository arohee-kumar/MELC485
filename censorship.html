      Censorship in the Middle East
    </h1>
    <p>
    Censorship plays a large role in how governments in the Middle East keep control over their citizens. It is used to portray the government in charge in a positive light. The <a href="https://www.iranintl.com/en/202312077744">"Iranian regime strictly controls internet access, frequently imposing blackouts during sensitive times, such as widespread protests". </a> People in the Middle East combat this practice by using VPNs to circumvent the blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
    Online platforms like Twitter and Facebook aren't the only things that are censored. Poets, authors, and journalists are all also monitored and are in danger if they have provocative writings. 
    </p>

    <h3><a href="https://journalismisnotacrime.com/en/">JournalismIsNotACrime</a></h3>
    <p>
    The website JournalismIsNotACrime displays many of the journalists and activists who have been imprisoned, tortured, and killed in Iran. An example of one profile is of the exiled journalist Masoud Hoseini Lavasani who was sentenced to prison for six years and banned from journalism for ten years. He was arrested for his work as a reporter on "Disaster in Revolution Square" which was a report on the June 20th, 2009 rally that resulted in more that 60 protestors dying. He wrote the article under a pseudonym and was still found and imprisoned. Lavasani was finally able to escape the country and now lives in exile.

    <h3><a href="https://rsf.org/en">ReportersWithoutBorders</a></h3>
    <p>
    On the website ReportersWithoutBorders, Iran is ranked at 176/180  and Egypt is at 170/180. THis means that Iran and Egypt are some of the most repressed countries in the world. All the news sources that are allowed to publish are state-owned nationalist news sources. In Iran most news comes from media that is based outside of Iran. Independent media is often blocked and the journalists that run them are unfairly persecuted. In Egypt, they mostly relay political propaganda that is <a href = "https://rsf.org/en/country/egypt#media-outlets-12052" target="_blank">"monitored by the state, intelligence agencies or wealthy businessmen."</a> If a news source refused to be censored or follow the guidelines set by the government, they are blocked.

    <p>
    In the early 2000s many users used the internet to go around Iran's strict press laws. Once President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took office in 2005, censorship grew and many of those websites were blocked. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Specifically after the 2009 election protests, Iran passed the Computer Crimes Law. This act provides rules for internet censorship. Four important articles from this act are Article 10, 14, 21, and 48. Article 10 prohibits internet users from protecting their data and using encryption. Article 14 prohibits "producing, sending, publishing, distributing, saving or financially engaging in obscene content". Article 21 allows maintaining records of personal information of the internet users. And finally, Article 48 allows Internet Service Providers (ISP) to surveil telephone conversations.

    <p>
    In Egypt, after the revolution, there was a cyber law passed called the Anti-Cyber and Information Technology Crimes Law in August of 2018. It is meant to "secure digital spaces" but blocks websites that provide news which discredit the government. Article 2 requires telecommunication companies to retain and store user data so authorities can identify the users, metadata, and computer IP address. Article 7 grants the investigative authorities the power to block any website whenever they deem that the website’s content promotes extremist ideas that violate national security or damages the Egyptian economy
