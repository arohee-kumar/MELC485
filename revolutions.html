        Green Movement
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Green Movement was a political movement that started on June 12, 2009 after the Iranian presidential elections and lasted until 2010. The incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was running for re-election after being elected for the first time in 2005. The first time President Ahmadinejad ran, he promised the people that <a href="https://www.cfr.org/interview/irans-shaky-ahmadinejad" target="_blank">"[He] will better distribute the existing wealth."</a> and <a href="https://www.cfr.org/interview/irans-shaky-ahmadinejad" target="_blank"></a>"[He]'ll bring the oil money to the people's tables."</a> He didn't deliver on his campaign promises of <a href="https://www.cfr.org/interview/irans-shaky-ahmadinejad" target="_blank"></a>"combating corruption; improving the economy; dealing with issues of social justice and unemployment, especially for the young; and creating greater opportunities for people."</a> During his term the economy got worse, Iranian people had to deal with <a href="https://www.cfr.org/interview/irans-shaky-ahmadinejad" target="_blank">more international sanctions, and higher inflation rates.</a> The people wanted this to change and challenged the outcome of the election.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Revolution of 1979 also played a part in the Green Revolution. The majority of the Iranian public was involved: the middle class, the poor, the women's groups, the student groups, members of the bazaar, and people of the new industrialist class. A faction of these people were led by <a href="https://iranprimer.usip.org/resource/green-movement" target="_blank">Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Mir Hossein Mousavi and his wife Zahra Rahnavard.</a> Another revolutionary coalition was made up of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), and Basij. These revolutionary group was able to overthrow the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Ayatollah Khomeini then served as the first supreme leader of Iran. Khomeini didn't allow the IRGC to be included in politics, but once he passed and  Ali Khamenei took place as the second supreme leader, the IRGC was allowed to become involved.
