    <h3>Blogging in Egypt</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www-jstor-org.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/stable/23253706?seq=1">From The Blogosphere To The Street: Social Media and Egyptian Revolution</a> does a great job of explaining how blogging helped the public make their voice hear in Egypt. Blogging became popular in Egypt around 2004. It was used to have a platform where politcal and activist conversations could occur between people that don't agree on fundamental ideas. People from the Muslim Brotherhood and secular-liberal ones were having productive conversations on how they dislike and reject the Mubarak regime. The blog platform removed the debate of secularism vs. fundamentalism and allowed people to debate on the issues that were actually affecting them. The language used deviated from what was considered "standard". Rather than using formal Arabic, bloggers used the Egyptian dialect. This may have led to the people feeling more connected to each other and in turn to the issues that they all were facing with the Mubarak regime. By using colloquial and vulgar language, blogs were able to get the attention of secular-leftists and Islamists because it was so different from the formal language used by the oppressive political institutions.

When the election results were shared, the Internet was shut down for a brief period and then restarted, most likely to set filters on YouTube and Facebook.

      Egypt. On January 25th, 2011, Twitter was blocked by State Security Investigation Service. The next day Facebook was shut down. Finally, during the night of January 27th, The government shut down SMS and the Internet.

      Instead protestors used back channels like WhatsApp and email platforms to communicate. Primarily depending on Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo to connect to one another. BBC states that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12400319" target="_blank">"when one channel of communication is blocked, people try another."</a> People were using mobile phones, placards, newspapers, leaflets, messages carved into stones, and al-Jazeera's TV cameras.
